# Guided Exercise: Terminal Game

## Day 1
Let's start with a very simple version of a turn based text adventure.

### Game Loop & Input
First we add a game loop which constantly prompts the player for input and then executes some game action.

### Game State
Let's talk about State Machine.
Then we add a way to handle "State" 
in our game.

### Commands
Commands describe the change to our game state.  
Let us start with the move command.


## Day 2
We will add some game idea, a win and a loss condition.
Add more commands to collect items and show collected items.
Also let's save the current game state to our database.

* Come up with some narrative about the player character
  * Are we a fish, a drop of water, some plastic trash?
* Come up with some possible win- and loss-conditions
  * From a story perspective
  * And from a mechanical perspective

## Day 3
We will create random items when a new game is started.
Let's add caching to our app.

## Day 4
