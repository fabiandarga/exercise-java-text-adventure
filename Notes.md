* Come up with some narrative about the player character
    * Are we a fish, a drop of water, some plastic trash?
    * ->  Salmon

    * From a story perspective
        * -> Find Nemo
    * And from a mechanical perspective
        * The player has only 10 actions
        * -> collect some points to follow a lead
        * loose:
            * -> get eaten
            * -> get stranded
            * -> get poised
